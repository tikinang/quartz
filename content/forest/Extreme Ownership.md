# Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win
*Jocko Willink*

## Notes and Thoughts
- when it comes to performance standards: "It's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate..."
- "There are no bad teams. Only bad leaders."
- leader must be a TRUE believer in the mission
- when the leaders receive an order that they don't understand, they must ask Why? Why are we being asked to do this? Take a step back, deconstruct the situation, analyze strategic picture and then come to conclusions.. or ask higher Why?
