I, `(name)`, want to invest my

`(money/time)`

into

`(cause)`

because

`(reason)`.

- [ ] I have enough reserves and/or the risk of loss to possible gain is adequate and well considered.
- [ ] I studied the cause well enough to make this rational decision. There are no features of this investment, that can catch me of guard.
- [ ] I weighted following pros and cons.

| pros | cons |
| :--: |:----:|
| foo  | bar  |

- [ ] I discussed this investment with at least two people, who are not blind to the discussed matter. They are `(first_person)` and `(second_person)`, and they know about my intentions.
- [ ] I've checked [[forest/Investment Guidelines 2022#The Goals And Intentions|My Goals And Intentions]] and [[forest/Investment Guidelines 2022#The Guidelines|The Guidelines]] and everything seems to fit.

> [Ratio Decidendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_decidendi), be my guidance.
