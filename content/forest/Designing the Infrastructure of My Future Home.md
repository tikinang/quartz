# What do I need and what do I want?
Needs are adjusted for a modern human.

### Needs
- safeness from other people, animals and weather conditions (cold, heat, rain, wind)
- stability of air humidity and purity and room temperature
- source of drinkable water
- source of harmless water for cleaning and washing
- source of heat for heating and cooking food
- sources of light
- calm and private space for all residents
- food storage
- cleaning and housekeeping tools
- health harmlessnes of used materials

### Wants
I took inspiration [[forest/Features of My Future Home|here]].
- electricity
- internet connection
- sunny and coverable place for chilling out (such as terrace)
- sustainability
	- no fossil fuels burning
	- low use of emission producing building materials and processes
	- efficient waste management
	- water preservation
- semi-self-sufficiency (can withstand weeks without intake of external resources)
	- warmth
	- water
	- food
	- electricity
- energy efficiency
- vegetable garden, herb rock garden
- space for household animals (dogs, cats, hens, rabbits, maybe a sheep or two)
- gamer's room / home office
- cold water source for cold showers **all year round**
- play room (darts, gaming console, pool, foosball, fireplace, library, toy bricks, piano)
- finnish sauna
- outside workout bars
- quite big family (~1 wife and 4 kids)
- drying room

I didn't account for earthquakes, nor tornadoes, nor hurricanes, nor vulcano erruptions, nor tsunamis, nor floods, since the home will be situated in mild conditions of Czech Republic and not close to big rivers.

# What are the possibilities for satisfying them? (infrastructure-wise)
It is going to be some kind of covered, insulated shelter, using electricity or biomass-based fuels (wood or biomass-pelets) as main source of heat and electricity as main source light and mover energy. Since it should be built sustainably, use X materials. *EXPLORE: What materials to use? [[forest/Wood or masonry?|Wood or masonry?]]*

### Covering the needs

composting, waste-water treatment plant, rain water and treated water collection, wood storage and fireplace with heat exchanger, internet can provide Elon with Starlink if necessary, connection to public electrical grid, connection to public water grid, large plot (=pozemek), solar panels, food-producing garden and homestead (=place for domestic animals), high capacity battery, diesel generator, cellar

#### Energy management
If our household would need around 20kWh / day -> ~400kWh / 3 weeks, the household would need something around 33,000Ah of capacity of 12V lithium batteries. Said in money terms 33,000Ah / 200Ah * 30,000CZK = ~5mil. CZK...

That is a lot and it really doesn't make sense to have this huge capacity. More suitable would be to use diesel generator for emergency or black-out situations and store some ~2000Ah (~300,000CZK). You can store enough diesel for 3 weeks very easily. 1 liter of diesel can hold ~10kWh of energy. With generator 35% efficient you need only around 114l of diesel to have stored - which is nothing. But not forget, that the solar panels should create at least some energy even in winter.

*EXPLORE: Maybe create Google Sheet to calculate these values.*

### Drawbacks

### Advantages

# Diagram

## v1
A naive solution. Things to improve:
- [ ] add diesel generator
- [ ] more specific descriptions
- [ ] translate to english
- [ ] correct setup for electric circuit breaker (=jistič) and transformer (=měnič)
- [ ] add all water flows (and air flows)

## v2
To be continued... :)
