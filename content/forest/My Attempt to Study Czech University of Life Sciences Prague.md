Well yeah... Again...

I have collected a few notes from lectures.
- [[forest/Agrochemie]]
- [[forest/Botanika]]
- [[forest/Zoologie]]
- [[forest/Informační systémy]]
- [[forest/Agroekologie]]

I find some information useful, but i still wasn't able to force myself to study. What a shame.
- [[forest/Agroekologie#^82b050]] - plants use only some wavelengths from sunlight, because of the pigments in them (chlorophyl can absorb only red and blue wavelenghts)
	- maybe could be used in agriculture to save energy (lightbath the plants only with wavelenghts they can absorb) -> [[forest/8 Business Ideas for Starters#1. Light Optimizing Greenhouses]]
- [[forest/Informační systémy#^952175]] for posting job offers for students and graduates
