This little writing will contain my guidelines for investing in 2022 and forward. I will summarize here my **goals and intentions** of investing. And from that point of knowing where I want to go, I will try to find the optimal way(s) of getting there. I will focus both on investing my **wealth** but also (and more interestingly) on investing my **time**, for I believe that **time is the most valuable resource** man has in his disposal.

I had some thoughts about this in the past: ![[forest/Where to Put My Money|Where to Put My Money]]
I think, I really want to go in that direction. I have the **economic power** to change things. Where I put my money matters. Well funded things thrive, underfunded things die.

Part of this writing will be a **form**, that I will need to fill out before and in order to make some (significant) investment. It should really make clear whether the investment is the right thing to do aligned with my goals and intentions.

# The Goals And Intentions
- secure and increase my economic power, my wealth *EXPLORE: To what extent? Why?*
- help causes, that are important to me and that are aligned with my morale and values system
- save as much time and effort as possible, I don't want to over-manage, apply [[forest/KISS Principle#^d0d230|KISS principle]]
# The Guidelines
## When to invest?
- in recession, when the markets are "down", when bubbles burst *EXPLORE: How to spot that? How do I determine moment, when the markets are "down"?*
- when I have enough money to do so, always keep some cash reserves *EXPLORE: How large?*
- when there is evidence, that given investment will increase in value
- after filling the form and consulting the idea with smart and critical people (Narek, Mikuláš, ...)
