I don't see any other career path or path of life (think monk-way-of-life or becoming full-time dad) than becoming entrepreneur. Heck, I wouldn't like to be solely a [[forest/Entrepreneur-Athlete-Scientist Trio|scientist or athlete]]. I don't know what is it in me, but I wouldn't be satisfied, until I "die trying" finding out, **if I can make it or not**. Is it possible to be successful entrepreneur for a person like me? I know I would have to live with the "What if?" for the rest of my life. That is why I need to make it or "die trying" to be at peace. It is my highest mission. **Becoming entrepreneur**. I don't see anything more exciting or promising than that. I am very clear about it, even though I don't exactly know why. But hopefully I will find my why in the process.
