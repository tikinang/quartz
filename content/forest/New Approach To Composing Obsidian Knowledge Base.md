title: New Approach To Composing Obsidian Knowledge Base

It should be more like an exploration - a forest, a huge garden full of surprises, often to be (re-)explored, (re-)navigated, (re-)connected. With a few well known paths and singposts (word for today - **signpost**  - tables with directions), so entities do not get completely lost. It should be mainly for fun and for exploration, **a walk in the forest**. Not a rigid formal structure of notes.
Ground and archive for all **my** thoughts and ideas... For **my own** representation and projection of structures in my head. Interconnected, scattered around. 
Make parts visible and  for others by publishing. Let others have a peek in my treasure (and trash) garden.
It should be mainly for myself and for fun from exploration. No rigid rules or structures. Just thoughts exploration. This should be new manifesto of this forest.
No archive folder, just one folder with all the notes, although with some more important notes than others (signposts).

Lets take a walk.. pathing job

## Obsidian 'Random Note' plugin
Obsidian offers a core plugin, that opens a random note on a click of a button.

# Transformation
- [X] change TODO to EXPLORE
- [X] remove most of the tags
	- [X] replace `#wip` with `#draft` 
- [X] remove deprecated files (are there any?)
