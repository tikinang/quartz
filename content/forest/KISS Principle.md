KISS = "Keep It Simple Stupid" ^d0d230

I first encountered it in the book *EXPLORE: Reference to the book.* about Ray Kroc, the founder (or at least *EXPLORE: Word from someone who popularized or enlarged the thing?*) of McDonald. He applied and stressed this principle. The more complex things are, the likelihood of success diminishes. So... KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID!
