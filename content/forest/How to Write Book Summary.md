### The Goal
The goal of my personal book summary is to **connect and embed the thoughts** presented in the book into my personal active knowledge. Insert it **into my internal structuralization**. And if possible, create for myself **actionable steps**. 
I write it for myself, so **keep it simple** and move fast forward.
### Step by Step
1. read the book and collect notes and thoughts on the matter
2. throughout the reading of the book:
	1. try to discuss the matter with others
	2. try to connect it to personal experiences happening in the moment or to those that happened in the past
3. process the notes
4. create and upload a mind map
5. than read a few online summaries to maybe catch some missing parts or to broaden your view on the matter
6. fine-tune and polish your summary and read it again
